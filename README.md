# Organisational-Informatics-244-Mock-A2-Assessment-2025-Attempt-2
This repository is for practicing JavaScript in preparation for the A2

This mock test is based off the 2024 A2. Note that this is out of 50, the real test will be longer, out of 100.

For each of the questions below, answer the question in a solution.js file. This mock is not submitted, but if it was, you would submit the single file only to SocSciLearn at the end of the test. To test your code, you should write an index.html and then use the Python web server to test it. Remember, in the lab, you can use python -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 to run the web server.

JavaScript Questions All questions are to be answered in the solution.js file provided.

1. [3] Define three variables using let, assigning them to a string, a boolean, and a number respectively.

2. [10] Write five different comparisons between two values that produce a boolean result, and then add a comment that gives the result and explains your answer (e.g., 5 > 3 //true; 5 is greater than 3). You must use at least three different comparison operators, and include at least one comparison using the strict equality operator (===).

3. [2] Output the equation "5 * 4 = 20" by calculating the answer (20) and using a template literal for the result.

4. [2] Provide two different ways of converting a number to a string.

5. [3] Write a boolean expression that uses all three of the logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).

6. [5] Write a function that takes a single number as a parameter and returns a boolean depending on whether the input number is positive (true) or negative zero (false).

7. [10] Write two loops, one for loop, and one while loop which each output the numbers 1 through 10 inclusive.

8. [5] Prompt the user for a number, then using a single if statement, output a message if the input number is either 5, or 13, or is divisible by 3.

9. [10] Prompt the user for their favourite season. You can assume they will only provide one of "summer", "winter", "autumn", and "spring". Use a chained if .. else if statement to output a different message depending on their selection. Now write an alternative way of solving this problem using a switch statement instead of the if .. else if chain
